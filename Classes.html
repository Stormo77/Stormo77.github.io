		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<h3>There are many classes to choose from in D&D with some people even making
		their own!</h3>
		<!--Text-->
		The classes that you can chose from are as follows The
		Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rouge,
		Socrcerer, warlock, Wizard. 
	  You can pick anyone you want whether you are wanting to be a magic user or a plain person
		with a specific set of skills	 like for example the ranger or rouge, my recomendation for a starting 
		person is to become a warrior for your first campaign to get the hang of mecanics regarding combat
		and other activities as the warrior is an allrounder able to specialize in archery or hand to hand
		combat then if you decide meele isnt for you you would go onto the ranger or a magic user if you decided
		hand to hand is for you you'd most likely go barbarian monk paladin or rouge though ofcource the warrior
		is a good choice for these either way. The images below can help you decide too!

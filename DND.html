<div id="DND"> <h1>D&D is a roleplaying game which you can play as multiple classes, races and allignments</h1>
<p1>You start by grabing a character sheet for your edition </p1> 
 <a id="Sheet" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/trpg-resources/trpg-resources">Charactersheet<a/>
<p1>Then you fill it out by going over various steps, one of the most important step is to roll your characters stats there are many ways to roll you can do it by rolling four six sided dice discarding the lowest and tallying them together then doing this 5 more times so you have six numbers between three to eighteen, you could used the standard 15 14 13 12 10 and 8 as your characters stats. Later you'll use these stats depending on your class, each stat has a modifier, 1=-5 2-3=-4 4-5=-3 6-7=-2 8-9=-1 10-11=+0 12-13=+1 14-15=+2 16-17=+3 18-19=+4 20-21=+5 22-23= +6 24-25=+7 26-27=+8 28-29=+9 30=+10 these add to your dice rolls depending on where they are assigned </p1>
